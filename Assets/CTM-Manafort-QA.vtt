time that suggest that it may be slipping time is of the estimate and more

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.330
week like this they make it impossible to catch up well that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.080

...with nobels so this is all cash...cash on hand so, no, we're fairly 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.080
we're...comfortable what we are concerned comfortable where we are organizationally

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.770
we're not comfortable with is the narrative that the media seems to be taking which is which is building

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.560
a storyline of that the democrats are controlling the race the word feel

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.640
comfortable if you look at our messages this...going to be...change

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.010
...and all the polls...talk about change you're talking about a, 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.160
you know, the khan family...whole range of things they're not that change and not

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.000
about issues well we were talking about changes...way...we will be for the rest of this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.080
...next week we'll be talking about economic plan you know, the khan family situation that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.970

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.890
...about...the blue water...as we all...but what he was a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.710
...to talk about was the issue with the war the...the...let 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.060
you agree...has been a very bad week for the trump campaign and how

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.220
did how are you guys able to ignore the dropping poll numbers

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.060
and the defection that are happening...poll numbers were expected...the democratic of

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.160
...expect...this...drop depends on which poll you look and you know,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.860
we feel like in another week or...are going to even out we always thought that we had a bounce we knew

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.060
that democrats...and, in...you see in the situation...looks like an

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.770
...field but in two weeks we think that's going to even out...out there on a message which we will

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.190
be the framework of this election favors donald trump if we run the campaign that we're

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.680
...running...we think...going to win we don't plan on

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.550
...in august we plan awaited november...in that will become evident...campaign

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.600
deploys there's a lot going...the local levels that you're not seeing that he doesn't seem to appear to stay on 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.540
